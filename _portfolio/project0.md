●Enhanced EfficientNet-B0 by adding custom top layers and applying transfer learning to fine-tune the model, training on the TuSimple dataset for robust lane detection using monocular RGB camera inputs in the IGN Gazebo Sonoma Raceway simulation environment.  
●Designed and implemented a vision-based controller in ROS 2 to compute optimal linear and angular velocity commands, enabling precise autonomous trajectory tracking along detected lanes.
