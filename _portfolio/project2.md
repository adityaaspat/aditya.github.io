Developed autonomous parking solutions using advanced deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques,
including DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), and SAC
(Soft Actor-Critic). Implemented and fine-tuned deep RL algorithms to achieve optimal parking behavior in shorter durations
utilizing CUDA to accelerate computations and enhance performance. Integrated feature association using semi-gradient SARSA to map continuous environmental features to
appropriate discrete actions effectively.
